            Matching Tires, Rims, and Rim Parts
            Always use approved tire and rim combinations, sizes, contours, and tapers. Most tires will fit on more than one
            rim width. Always use the correct tire for the rim.
            There is a danger of serious injury or death if a tire of one bead diameter is installed on a rim with a different diame
           ter. Always replace a tire with another tire of exactly the same bead diameter designation and suffix letters.
            Example
            <strong>
            • Mount a 16 inch tire on a 16 inch rim.
            • Never mount a 16 inch tire on a 16.1 inch or 16.5 inch rim.

            • Mount a 16.5 inch tire on a 16.5 inch rim.
            • Never mount a 16.5 inch tire on a 16 inch or 16.1 inch rim.

            <strong> <mark> Repairing Tires and Rims </mark> </strong>
            DO NOTmakeany repairs to a tire unless the repairs are authorized and recommended by the tire industry and/or
            tire manufacturer.
            Never drive on an improperly repaired tire, which may cause further damage and eventual tire failure resulting in
            personal injury or death.
            Never repair a tire without removing the tire from the rim assembly and never use a tube as a substitute for a tire re
           pair or replacement. Always use an inside patch and a plug to repair a tire unless the hole is too small to insert a
            plug. DO NOTuse a plug without an inside patch to repair a tire.
            Never repair a tire with less tread than the tread wear indicators (where available), with a puncture larger than 6.4
            mm(.25 in)diameter, and/or damage outside the tread or sidewall area. These tires must be replaced because they
            cannot be safely repaired.
            DO NOTattempt to repair a tire using an aerosol fixer to inflate and seal the tire. An aerosol fixer may contain highly
            volatile gas that can be ignited by an excessive heat source, flame, or sparks, Any tire with an aerosol fixer must be
            removed from all heat sources and be completely deflated before removing the tire from the rim.
           <strong> Tire Changing Equipment / Tools</strong>
            Several types of tire changing equipment are available and service technicians must be fully trained in the correct
            safety procedures and instructions for any specific tire changing machine. Always read and understand any warn
           ings contained in the manufacturer's manuals or attached to the equipment.
            If used, keep a firm grip on tire irons. They may spring back, resulting in personal injury.
            When using a bead breaker, always stand to one side of the rim to maintain control of the bead breaker and DO NOT
            hold the bead breaker when breaking the tire bead. If the bead breaker is not seated properly and flies off the rim, it
            could cause serious injury or death.
