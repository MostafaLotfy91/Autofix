        Car Repair Terms and Conditions (B2C)
        
        These Car Repair Terms and Conditions (B2C) are designed for use by garages or repair shops providing repair services for a variety of vehicles. This document is also suitable for the provision of routine and non-routine maintenance. An optional provision is included in these terms and conditions which covers the provision of courtesy cars.
        
        These terms are not vehicle-specific and so can be applied to repairs for any type of vehicle, including trailers, caravans and commercial type vehicles provided that in each case the garage’s customer acts as a “consumer” in relation to receipt of the garage’s services. “Consumer” is defined in the Consumer Rights Act 2015 as an individual who receives services for his/her personal use and for purposes wholly or mainly outside the business of that individual or another. Since these terms are designed to be used only in a transaction with a “consumer”, they are less likely to be applicable where the vehicle is of a type designed for commercial use (rather than, say, a private car). Consumer customers may nevertheless be using such commercial types of vehicle for non-commercial purposes in which case these terms should be used.
        
        However, where the garages customer is not acting as a consumer in relation to services in respect of any type of vehicle (i.e. the customer is receiving the services wholly or mainly for his business purposes), we have provided an accompanying alternative set of terms for garages to use, the Car Repair Terms and Conditions (B2B).
        
        These Car Repair Terms and Conditions (B2C) are suitable for use whether the contract is an on premises, off premises or <strong> contract</strong> as defined in the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013. The Regulations require you to supply certain information to customers who are consumers before they make a booking for any work. Where the contract is an “off premises” or “distance” contract (but not an “on premises” contract), the Regulations also confer on the customer certain rights to cancel the booking, and we have set these out in the terms themselves.
        
        This template takes full account of the Consumer Rights Act 2015 and the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013.
        
        Optional phrases / clauses are enclosed in square brackets. These should be read carefully and selected so as to be compatible with one another. Unused options should be removed from the document.
        
        This version of these terms is for use by general users who are not members of the Vehicle Builders and Repairers Association (VBRA) or any other specific trade association (or similar group). An alternative version of this document, the Car Repair Terms and Conditions (VBRA version) (B2C), (also updated), is available in this subfolder for members of the VBRA: it contains specific clauses relevant to that organisation.
