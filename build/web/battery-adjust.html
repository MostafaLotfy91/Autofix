 <h3>When it comes to car batteries, understanding their voltage is crucial to ensuring that they are functioning optimally. In this section, we will discuss the basics of battery voltage and how it relates to the state of charge of your car battery.</h3>
<h1>Basics of Battery Voltage</h1>
<h3>The voltage of a car battery is a measurement of the electrical potential difference between the positive and negative terminals of the battery. A fully charged car battery typically measures around 12.6 volts, with a normal voltage range of 12.4 to 12.7 volts.
 It is important to note that the voltage of a car battery can vary depending on several factors. These factors include the age of the battery, the temperature, and the level of charge. For instance, a weak battery may have a voltage reading of less than 12.2 volts, while a fully charged battery may have a voltage reading of up to 12.8 volts.
<h3>The state of charge of a car battery is a measure of the amount of electrical energy stored in the battery. It is typically expressed as a percentage, with a fully charged battery having a state of charge of 100%.
